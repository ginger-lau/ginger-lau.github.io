					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that Gestalt principles are built on four key ideas. This includes emergence, reification, multi-stability, and invariance. 
								It was cool to learn about the different ways users can percieve information just based on the way it is presented.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article were the examples. I really liked how I could see the principle in simple form as well as 
								how it can be adapted for a website. I think I would have also benefitted from seeing and "anti-example". Otherwise, overall, it was 
								a very helpful article. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Our brain matches what we see with familiar patterns stored in our memory and fills in the gaps." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
