							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that animation is more than just the transformation of things over a set of time steps. It is also important to consider
								the size of the object that is being animated - smaller objects should move faster than larger ones. In addition, the size of the interface
								plays a role in the speed of animation. Smaller screens should have faster animations and larger screens should have slower animations.
								Lastly, it is also important to consider the cohesion of the animations on a page. For instance, all of the elements should move with a  subordinate interaction. 
								That way, users can easily see what central element to focus on. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the explanation of all of the Easing functions. 
								They walked through some examples that made it very clear why some easing functions have very 
								specific use cases. The animations highlighted how even the order of easing and animation can affect
								a users flow.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p align="center"> Web animation is treated in a different way. Since we are 
								ccustomed to an almost instant opening of web-pages in a browser, we expect 
								to transit between different states quickly as well. So, the duration of web 
								transitions should last about 2 times shorter than on mobile devices — between
								 150–200 ms.  </p>
