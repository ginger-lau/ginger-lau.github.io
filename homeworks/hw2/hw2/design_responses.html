						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned about the value of white space, or 'padding', as it is referred to in the design field. By leaving white space, it makes
								contents easier for the human eye to view and process. This is useful in situations that have a lot of content including images and text – by intentionally putting
								space between items, it makes the website look less clutters and easier to process.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this article is the examples of how wayfair uses white space. By showing me an example of where there is and isn't white space
								I was able to better understand the value of white space. The article had an example from a product page and an example of a homepage - this let me realize
								that whitespace is useful in every part of a website. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p align="center">"There is this myth that users will not always scroll to see all the content on a page. Thus, some of our stakeholders request that the majority of a page’s content lives above the fold."" </p>
							<p>I thought this was compelling because I would run into this thought about space wasted when it comes to including white space. It was reassuring to read that users will scroll despite the extra space. 
								The extra padding makes the content more palatteable and engaging.
							</p>
