					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> The 'favorite' website I will be using in this assignment is <a href="https://www.ikea.com/">IKEA</a></p>
							<p> This is what the exisiting website looks like </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/Ikea Homepage.png">
							
							<p>This can be viewed as a wireframe like this: </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/Ikea Homepage Wireframe.png">
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> Using the principles of symmetry and asymmetry to highlight the promotions, a new wireframe could look like: </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/Ikea Homepage Wireframe Edit.png"
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p>The goal of the website is to highlight furniture items people can purchase. The website is intended for people such as students, homeowners, renters, and interior designers. 
								The design accomplishes this by showing product images and highlight promotions to encourage sales. A text area can highlight company objectives and add to their 
								company image.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p>The exisitng IKEA website only highlights 3 images within initial viewing of the page. Since the purpose of the website is to highlight the variety of products they sell,
								I added a carousel so many products can be highlighted. In addition, the text area gives a chance for Ikea to add a <em>company objective</em> that way customers can feel
								connected. This also works inconjuction with the promotion that is placed on the right which uses the asymmetry design princple to redirect attn to it.</p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
